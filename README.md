## **Initializing Database & Start Service:**
##### copy 'wordleauth' into your nginx directory (/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/)
##### restart nginx `sudo service nginx restart`
##### install ngrok `curl -s https://bin.equinox.io/c/bNyj1mQVY4c/ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.tgz | tar xzf - -C $HOME/.local/bin` and forward to port `5000`
##### install Ruby `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt install --yes ruby-sinatra`
##### install RQ `python3 -m pip install rq`
##### instsall HTTPX `python3 -m pip install httpx`
##### navigate to project directory
##### to setup file structures for litefs database replication, run `python3 setup.py`  *if setup.py fails, manually delete the folder /database/dbs* 
###### *Make sure you have redis installed and it's not running.  you can check with the command `pgrep redis`*
##### run `foreman start` before populating datbases
##### setup the databases by running `python3 setupDB.py`  *use `setupDB.py -p` to populate the database.  Note it resets the redis db as well*
###### *if the project fails to start, delete the dbs folder and run setup again. Check again that redis is not running.  Litefs is included but if the replication services are failing, you may need to redownload Litefs and add it into /src/database/ and try again.*

## **Testing the APIs**

#### *Can test using user-id: 123abc and username: user1.  Username is not checked but included for redundancy*
#### *includes games g1 and g2 as test games.  game_ids are shortend here for ease of use but are uuids in game*
#### *make sure to use the correct user-id.  Supplying an incorrect user-id after you have logged in will result in resources not being found as username and user-id will not match. When using /game/create you will be able to create games even with an incorrect user-id but you will not be able to access them.*
